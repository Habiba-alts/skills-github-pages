I'M DOING IT!. I AM LEARNING A TECH SKILL. FINALLY  

I’ve always had a keen interest in technology — from the gadgets I use daily to the endless possibilities of innovation. However, my background has been far from technical, and despite my enthusiasm for the field, it has been a struggle to just get moving.  

Starting a new learning journey is always exciting, but for someone without a tech background, it can feel like stepping into the unknown. For me, that journey began when I enrolled in the cybersecurity diploma program at AltSchool. One of the biggest hurdles I faced was the fear of being "too late" or "too inexperienced" to start. I was worried I wouldn’t understand basic concepts, or that I’d fall behind in the coursework. But I realized that the only way to overcome this fear was to start.  

AltSchool’s cybersecurity diploma program turned out to be an ideal fit for me. The curriculum is designed for people like me i.e., those who may not have a technical background but are eager to learn.
So, what made me choose cybersecurity? Well, I realized the growing importance of cybersecurity in our increasingly connected world. With more and more data moving online, it seems that every company, government, and individual is vulnerable to cyber threats. That vulnerability makes cybersecurity not just a useful skill but a critical one. The more I read, the more I realized that this field offers both job stability and an opportunity to be a part of something impactful.
In the coming years, I hope to obtain the skills necessary to excel in the field professionally as a Network security Engineer. 
As someone new to the cybersecurity space, I know I have a lot more to learn. But I also know that connecting with others in the field will be key to my success. That’s why I’m writing this post — to share my story and to connect with professionals who have been on a similar journey or who can offer advice and guidance.

If you’re a seasoned cybersecurity expert, I’d love to hear from you. What advice would you give someone just starting out?.
